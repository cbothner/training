Hey <%=@trainee.name.split(' ')[0] %>!

It's been three months since you first came down to check WCBN out; is your 
demo tape in?  Have you done Stage II?  Maybe you're already on the air?!

If you've got any questions, whether it's about finishing your demo tape, or 
learning to use Prod A to engineer for live performances, making a cart for 
your show, or getting involved with the exec board, hit us up.  Just reply 
to this email, and bam!

And let us know if you've got ideas to make the training process better, 
too.  WCBN is only our DJ's, so we're always looking for input on how to 
make it easier for our newest ones.

And if you've still got some work to do, hop to it!  Getting your first show 
will be awesome!  Here's a refresher on the how-to:

Keep on keepin' on,
