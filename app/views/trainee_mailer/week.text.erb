Dear <%= @trainee.name.split(' ')[0] %>,

It's been a week since you came to Stage One Training at WCBN.  We hope you've 
finished up your two hours of alphabetizing and are beginning to work on your 
demo tape.  About that, here are some things to keep in mind:

1. Variety!  Use this as a chance to check out a jazz artist you don't know much 
about, or some music from some other part of the world.  Get some experience 
with vinyl, too.  Remember, we're not really judging you on your music tastes, 
so feel free to get out of your comfort zone.

2. Do it live!  Many people want to meticulously plan out their demo tapes, and 
while some preparation is certainly for the better, the demo tape is only the 
first of many sets you'll do on the radio: feel free to just grab a stack of 
music, and play it by ear.

3. Get some help.  If you want some help with the tape deck, or if you just want 
to get to know some of us, come by during office hours:

For your reference, here's the next steps once again:

See you around,
