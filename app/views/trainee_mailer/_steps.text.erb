1.  Do your hour of alphabetizing.  This will help you familiarize yourself  
with our library and will make the demo tape process much easier for you.  
It's a quick hour!

2.  Make your demo tape!  Grab the key block from the DJ (call 734.763.3500 
if you need to be buzzed into the SAB), and get into Prod C and go!  
Remember, we're looking for *variety*.  Get outside your comfort zone.

3.  Do your Stage II Training.  This is where stuff really gets fun; Stage 
II is where you get to do some DJing.

4.  Do your apprenticeships! Hang out with 2 freeform and 2 specialty show 
DJs.  These folks will get you even more experience with the wonder that is 
WCBN.

5.  Get on the schedule!

If you have any questions during this process, shoot us an email!  You can 
just reply to this message and we'll get back to you ASAP.
